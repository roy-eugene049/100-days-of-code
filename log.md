# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 26, 2021 
##### (started learning react and created my first simple react app)

**Today's Progress**: Picked up on the basic concepts of creating an app with react, installed the relevant dependencies and really eaxcited for Day 2.

**Thoughts:** I've been working on my CSS and Js skills over the past few months and finally getting to start to learn a framework is definitely a milestone for me in my coding journey.

### Day 2: October 27, 2021 
##### (learned about JSX, function and class components and created a counter app)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about functional/class components and how JSK works.  Made a counter app that increments a counter variable every second and displays it on the page as a paragraph.

**Thoughts**:  I'm starting to get a hang of what React as a framework and JS library is all about. Learning how the DOM work and why React's Virtual DOM gives it an edge over other frontend technologies.

### Day 3: October 28, 2021 
##### (learned about props and state in functional/class components)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about props in functional/class components. Made a counter app that increments the counter each time a button is clicked. 

**Thoughts**: Props and state are essential when it comes to working with functional and class components.

### Day 4: October 29, 2021 
##### (learned about using hooks in functional components)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about hooks in functional components. Rewrote the code to the counter app from Day 3 using a functional component and hooks. 

**Thoughts**: Using hooks makes the code much shorter, cleaner and easier to read.

### Day 5: October 30, 2021 
##### (learned about lifecycle methods for both class and functional components)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about the lifecycle component methods that can be used in class components and functional components. 

**Thoughts**: Through lifecycle methods, we can then control what happens when each tiny section of our UI renders, updates, thinks about re-rendering, and then disappears entirely.

### Day 7: November 1, 2021 
##### (Covered Rendering a List and sharing state in React)

**Today's Progress**: Covered rendering a list, sharing state and created a Contact Manager. 

**Thoughts**: Props can be used not only to pass down state but also functions that may manipulate the state. In this way, we are able to store the application state in the parent and allow its child components to use and manipulate the state.

### Day 8: November 2, 2021 
##### (Covered Arrays in JavaScript)

**Today's Progress**: Covered Array accessibility and manioulation using the various methods and functions like pop() and push(). 

**Thoughts**: Each element in an array can store any of the data types, as well as other arrays. Array elements can also contain functions and JavaScript objects.

### Day 9: November 3, 2021 
##### (Made a Counter program with JavaScript)

**Today's Progress**: Put my knowledge of Handling Events into making a counter app that can increase and decrease an initial value of zero while changing the color when the value is both above and below zero. 

**Thoughts**: Understanding functions and handling events is instrumental when it comes to creating JavaScript programs.

### Day 10: November 4, 2021 
##### (Dived into JavaScript's library Redux)

**Today's Progress**: Went through the basics of understanding Redux.

### Day 11: November 5, 2021 
##### (Dived into deeper into Redux)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about the core concepts that Redux sticks by. This includes the 'Single source of truth', 'state is read-only', actions and reducers.

**Thoughts**: Redux was created to make state management predictable, providing a single state container and strict rules on how state can be changed.

### Day 12: November 6, 2021 
##### (Dived into deeper into Redux)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Reducer Functions.

**Thoughts**: Reducer functions are essential in handling multiple actions.

### Day 13: November 7, 2021 
##### (Counter App using React+Redux)

**Today's Progress**: Made a fully functional React+Redux Counter App. Learnt about creating stores in Redux, passing the connect() function using its two optional parameters and accessing the store. Making projects managable by seperating the source files for components, reducers and actions.

**Thoughts**: Implementing both React and Redux is great when building large scale apps that use many components, reducers and actions.
