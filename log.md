# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 26, 2021 
##### (started learning react and created my first simple react app)

**Today's Progress**: Picked up on the basic concepts of creating an app with react, installed the relevant dependencies and really eaxcited for Day 2.

**Thoughts:** I've been working on my CSS and Js skills over the past few months and finally getting to start to learn a framework is definitely a milestone for me in my coding journey.

### Day 2: October 27, 2021 
##### (learned about JSX, function and class components and created a counter app)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about functional and class components together with JSK. Made a counter app that increments a counter variable every second and displays it on the page as a paragraph.

**Thoughts**:  I'm starting to get a hang of what React as a framework and JS library is all about. Learning how the DOM work and why React's Virtual DOM gives it an edge over other frontend technologies.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
