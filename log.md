# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 26, 2021 
##### (started learning react and created my first simple react app)

**Today's Progress**: Picked up on the basic concepts of creating an app with react, installed the relevant dependencies and really eaxcited for Day 2.

**Thoughts:** I've been working on my CSS and Js skills over the past few months and finally getting to start to learn a framework is definitely a milestone for me in my coding journey.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
